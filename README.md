# Rook

### NOTE

### A quick note for everyone I will be to a massive overhaul of the original Rook called the Rook Evolution! This is going to be the final form of the printer with a ton of fixes and changes. The Rook Evolution will be available for  a small fee ( $10 CND )for the STL's as I am going to be building a website / manuals / paying for Github bandwidth. This will probably be a patreon tier. Rook Legacy and Rook 180 will always be free.

Welcome to the DIY 3D Printer called Rook!

This is a tiny mostly 3d printed CoreXY printer with a build volume of 120x120

### PLEASE NOTE THIS PRINTER IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

The goal of this printer is to make a cheap easy to build 3D printer than can be built by anyone.

## Features:

- 3D Printed Frame
- CoreXY
- Dual Lead Screws
- Only Roughly $260 USD in cost

## Build F.A.Q

- I print with 3 walls and 15 percent infill, if you want stronger go 4 walls 20 percent infill should be plenty
- I use PLA-PRO for the prototype and it worked well, ABS and ASA would be great too
- My Discord server has alot of mods for the Rook check it out
- This printer uses some heatset inserts in key places
- This printer uses all F695 bearings now no more 20t idlers
- There are slots in the motor mounts to tension the belts
